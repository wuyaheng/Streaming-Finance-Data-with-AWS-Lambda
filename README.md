# Streaming-Finance-Data-with-AWS-Lambda

In this project, I've collected one dayâ€™s worth of stock HIGH and LOW prices for each company listed below on December 1st, 2020, at a five minute interval with a Lambda function. This function is triggered every 5 minutes and places the collected data into a defined Kinesis Delivery Stream which was pointed to a S3 bucket as its destination. Then I configured AWS Glue to crawl this S3 bucket which allowed me to query the S3 files using AWS Athena to gain insight into the streamed data. Lastly, I created several plots in the jupyter notebook using the query output generated from Athena.
